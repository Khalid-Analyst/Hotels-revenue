## Goal
Develop a database to analyze and visualize hotel booking data.

## Requirements
Build a visual data story or dashboard using Power BI to present to your stakeholders.

## Questions That We Need to Answer
1. Is our hotel revenue growing?
2. Should we increase our parking lot size?
3. What trends can we see in the data?

### Data Visualization Tool: Power BI
### Data Source: Excel file

# Summary of Findings
1. The revenue started at **$4,948,782.01** in 2018 and grew by **170.74%** to **$13,379,641.83** in 2019. Subsequently, in 2020, it increased by **56.06%** to reach **$20,932,683.01**.
2. No, we shouldn't increase parking space; parking utilization is low.
3. We observe positive trends in our data: the **Average Daily Rate (ADR)** is rising, total nights stayed are increasing, and there's also a boost in the average discount.
